## Project Set Up

### Prerequisites

- `npm` and `pnpm` should be installed.
- `git` should be installed (recommended v2.4.11 or higher)

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkillUP-Africa-PWD-Org/frontend
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**

   Change your current directory to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   Now you can start the development server and begin developing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The project should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is already in use).
